## IMPORTS

# pandas
# beautifulsoup4
# requests

## USAGE

# With this project I was building a web scraping bot that would go and take information from flight information that
# could be used to get all results desired for the customer/user.
#
# The main project aim was to save the JSON information and later use it for the required information of the choice.

## PROBLEMS

# With this project I encountered the first main problem - for loop and how to reach the first flight information from
# the JSON information and how to reach the key values and where they were stored.
# Unfortunately, I was unable to finish all the steps as my trials were unsuccessful in regard to find the information
# for flights that have one step. As well I did not successfuly managed to save information the way I wanted which led
# into 2 lines for Outbound and Inbound flights.
#
# Tools: I decided to use the Pandas as they are much faster for larger datasets. Not sure if this amount of JSON
# information is counted as big.
